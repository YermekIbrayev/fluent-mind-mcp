# Feature Specification: Self-Learning Vector-Enhanced Chatflow Automation

**Feature Branch**: `002-flowise-automation-workflow`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Updated**: 2025-10-17 (v10)
**Status**: Draft - Clarified & Modularized
**Input**: User description: "create fully automated workflow for creation of flowise thru API call"
**Deployment Context**: Personal-use MCP server (single-user local deployment)
**MVP Scope**: Core Stories (US1, US2, US3, US7) - Essential chatflow automation with vector search, templates, and spec-driven workflow. Post-MVP Phase 1.5: US4, US5, US6 (vector DB population enhancements, error handling polish, dynamic catalog refresh). P2 Stories 8-11 deferred (learning system)

**Updates**:
- v1: Token-friendly script-based approach with minimal parameters
- v2: Vector database for node descriptions and flow templates with semantic search
- v3: Self-learning feedback system, new flow generation, specialized build functions, algorithmic node positioning
- v4: Added spec-driven development workflow for complex chatflows with human-in-the-loop validation
- v5: Added Flowise architecture reference and dynamic node catalog updates from live server
- v6: [INVESTIGATE] Added SDD artifact learning system - storing specs, plans, user inputs in vector DB for reuse without LLM fine-tuning
- v7: [INVESTIGATE] Enhanced learning system with failed SDD storage, user-corrected flow import, and session versioning for complete interaction history
- v8: **Modularization** - Split User Story 8 into 4 independently testable user stories (8, 9, 10, 11) following SDD best practices. Each story delivers independent value and can be prioritized separately.
- v9: **Clarification Session** - Resolved 13 critical ambiguities: dependency initialization (automatic), data retention (manual cleanup), error handling (circuit breaker pattern), testing strategy (manual checklists + critical path automation), MVP scope (P1 stories 1-7 only, P2 deferred). Added 115 new functional requirements, 7 NFR categories, 4 key entities, comprehensive edge cases, testing infrastructure requirements.
- v10: **Constitution Compliance** - Split 1210-line spec into 15 modular files (â‰¤160 lines each, 12 files â‰¤100 lines). Organized by domain: user stories, requirements, architecture, with navigation index. Follows Principle VIII: Token-Efficient Architecture.
