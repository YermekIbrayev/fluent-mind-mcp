## Assumptions

**General System Assumptions**:
- System designed for personal-use MCP server deployment (single-user local operation)
- User controls their own data and is responsible for not including sensitive information (API keys, credentials) in requests
- No multi-tenant features or cross-user data isolation required
- User has direct access to local file system and vector database for debugging/inspection

**MVP Scope & Delivery Assumptions**:
- MVP Phase 1 delivers User Stories 1-7 (P1 priority) providing complete end-to-end chatflow automation capability
- P1 stories (vector search, templates, build_flow, spec-driven workflow, dynamic catalog, circuit breaker, data management) represent fully functional system ready for real-world validation
- P2 stories (8: artifact learning, 9: failed storage, 10: corrected imports, 11: sessions) are valuable enhancements but not essential for core automation functionality
- Core system must be validated with real usage before investing in advanced learning infrastructure (P2 stories)
- Phased delivery follows lean/agile principles: deliver working system first, validate with usage, then enhance based on observed needs
- User can begin productive chatflow automation immediately after MVP Phase 1 completion without waiting for P2 features
- P2 features can be prioritized and developed independently based on actual usage patterns observed during Phase 1
