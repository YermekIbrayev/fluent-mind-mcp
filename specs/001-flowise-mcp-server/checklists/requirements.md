# Specification Quality Checklist: Fluent Mind MCP Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (implicit in user stories and requirements)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ✅ PASSED (All checklist items completed)

### Changes Made During Validation:
1. Removed implementation details from FR-002 (changed "REST API over HTTP/HTTPS" to "over network")
2. Removed implementation details from FR-006 (changed "JSON serialization/deserialization" to "workflow structure data serialization")
3. Removed implementation details from FR-009 (changed "environment variables" to "configuration")
4. Removed implementation details from FR-012 (changed "UUID format" to "chatflow identifiers")
5. Removed implementation details from FR-015 (changed "async HTTP client" to "without blocking other activities")
6. Updated Key Entities to remove technical terms (API Client → Service Client, JSON → structure)
7. Updated SC-001 to remove "MCP protocol" reference (changed to "standard discovery mechanism")
8. Updated SC-003 to remove "JSON" reference (changed to "workflow structure")
9. Updated SC-004 to remove "JSON" reference (changed to "malformed data")

### Specification Quality Assessment:
- **User Stories**: 5 prioritized stories (P1-P5) covering full lifecycle
- **Acceptance Scenarios**: 18 total scenarios across all user stories
- **Edge Cases**: 8 identified covering connectivity, validation, concurrency
- **Functional Requirements**: 15 clear, testable requirements
- **Success Criteria**: 8 measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
- **Scope**: Well-bounded to 8 Flowise operations

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
