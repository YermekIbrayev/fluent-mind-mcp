# Tasks: Fluent Mind MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-flowise-mcp-server`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-flowise-mcp-server/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Test-First Approach**: Tests are implemented FIRST (RED), then implementation makes them pass (GREEN), followed by refactoring

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/fluent_mind_mcp/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths follow plan.md structure

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

- [X] T110 Verify ‚â•80% overall coverage, 100% critical path (authentication, API comm, validation)
- [X] T111 Add missing unit tests for any uncovered code (focus on critical paths)

### Code Quality

- [X] T112 Run ruff linter and fix issues (ruff check src/)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3 (US1 - P1)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - MVP priority
- **Phase 4 (US2 - P2)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run parallel to US1 if staffed
- **Phase 5 (US3 - P3)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run parallel to US1/US2 if staffed
- **Phase 6 (US4 - P4)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run parallel to other stories if staffed
- **Phase 7 (US5 - P5)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion - Can run parallel to other stories if staffed
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Foundational phase complete ‚Üí No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2)**: Foundational phase complete ‚Üí No dependencies on other stories (independent)
- **US3 (P3)**: Foundational phase complete ‚Üí No dependencies on other stories (independent)
- **US4 (P4)**: Foundational phase complete ‚Üí No dependencies on other stories (independent)
- **US5 (P5)**: Foundational phase complete ‚Üí No dependencies on other stories (independent)

**Key Insight**: After Foundational phase, all 5 user stories are independent and can be developed in parallel!

### Within Each User Story (TDD Cycle)

1. **Tests FIRST** (RED): Write failing tests
2. **Verify RED**: Run tests, ensure they fail for right reason
3. **Implementation** (GREEN): Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Verify GREEN**: Run tests, ensure they pass
5. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
6. **Verify still GREEN**: Run tests again after refactor

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T003, T004, T005, T007 can run in parallel
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T008, T009, T010 (tests), then T012, T013, T014, T015, T016, T017 (implementations) can run in parallel
- **Within US1**: T019, T020, T021, T022 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Within US2**: T042, T043, T044, T045 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Within US3**: T057, T058, T059, T060 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Within US4**: T072, T073, T074, T075 (tests) can run in parallel
- **Within US5**: T085, T086, T087, T088 (tests) can run in parallel
- **User Stories**: US1-US5 can ALL run in parallel after Foundational phase (if team capacity)
- **Polish**: T098, T099, T102, T105, T106, T107, T108 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Step 1: Launch all tests for US1 together (RED):
Task T019: "Create test_flowise_client_read.py for GET operations"
Task T020: "Create test_chatflow_service_read.py for read/execute operations"
Task T021: "Create test_user_story_1.py acceptance tests"
Task T022: "Create test_full_lifecycle.py integration test setup"

# Step 2: Verify all tests FAIL (RED confirmed)

# Step 3: Implement in dependency order:
Task T023: "Create FlowiseClient class" (foundation)
Task T024-T026: "Implement list/get/run in FlowiseClient" (can be parallel)
Task T027: "Create ChatflowService" (depends on FlowiseClient)
Task T028-T030: "Implement service methods" (can be parallel after T027)
Task T031: "Create MCP server" (depends on service)
Task T032-T034: "Define MCP tools" (can be parallel after T031)
Task T035: "Add error handling"

# Step 4: Verify all tests PASS (GREEN)
Task T036-T038: Run unit, acceptance, integration tests

# Step 5: Refactor
Task T039-T041: Refactor and improve

# Result: US1 complete and independently deliverable
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Fastest path to value:**

1. ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T007) ‚Üí ~30 minutes
2. ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Foundational** (T008-T018) ‚Üí ~2 hours
   - Tests first (T008-T010)
   - Implementation (T011-T017)
   - Verify green (T018)
3. ‚úÖ **Phase 3: US1** (T019-T041) ‚Üí ~3 hours
   - Tests first (T019-T022)
   - Implementation (T023-T035)
   - Verify green (T036-T038)
   - Refactor (T039-T041)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: You now have a working MCP server!
5. **Test independently**: Can list, get, and execute chatflows
6. **Deploy/Demo**: MVP ready for users

**Total MVP Time**: ~5.5 hours (achievable in one focused day)

### Incremental Delivery

**Add one story at a time:**

1. **MVP (US1)**: Read and execute chatflows ‚Üí Deploy
2. **+US2**: Add creation capability ‚Üí Deploy
3. **+US3**: Add update capability ‚Üí Deploy
4. **+US4**: Add delete capability ‚Üí Deploy
5. **+US5**: Add generation capability ‚Üí Deploy
6. **+Polish**: Production hardening ‚Üí Final release

**Each deployment adds value without breaking previous features**

### Parallel Team Strategy

**With multiple developers:**

**Phase 1: Setup** (30 min, everyone together)

**Phase 2: Foundational** (2 hours, everyone together)
- Critical: Must complete before stories can proceed

**Phase 3+: User Stories** (parallel, ~3 hours each)
- Developer A: US1 (P1) - MVP priority
- Developer B: US2 (P2)
- Developer C: US3 (P3)
- Developer D: US4 (P4)
- Developer E: US5 (P5)

**Phase 8: Polish** (everyone together, integrate all stories)

**Total Parallel Time**: ~5.5 hours vs 17 hours sequential (3x faster!)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to specific user stories for traceability
- **Test-First**: RED (write failing test) ‚Üí GREEN (implement) ‚Üí REFACTOR (improve)
- **Each user story**: Independently completable and testable
- **Checkpoints**: Stop at any checkpoint to validate story works independently
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group of tasks
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **TDD Non-Negotiable**: Tests before implementation (constitution requirement)
- **Deliverable milestones**: Each phase ends with something deployable/testable

---

**Tasks Complete**: 122 tasks organized across 8 phases, TDD approach throughout, every user story independently testable and deliverable.
