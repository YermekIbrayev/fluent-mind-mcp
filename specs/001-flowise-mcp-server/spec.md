## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16

- Q: What level of observability (logging, metrics, tracing) is required for production operation? → A: Standard operational logging (errors, key operations, timing, warnings)
- Q: What are the expected concurrency and scalability limits for the system? → A: Small team deployment (5-10 concurrent AI assistants/operations)
- Q: What authorization model is required beyond authentication? → A: No authorization (all authenticated users have full permissions for all operations)
- Q: What Flowise versions should the system support? → A: Current stable version only (Flowise v1.x latest release at development time)
- Q: What are the expected data volumes and chatflow catalog size? → A: Small catalog (up to 100 chatflows, simple list operations)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Query and Execute Existing Chatflows (Priority: P1)

AI assistants need to list available Flowise chatflows, retrieve their details, and execute them with user input to integrate Flowise capabilities into conversational workflows.

**Why this priority**: Core read and execute operations enable immediate value by leveraging existing Flowise workflows without any modification. This is the foundation for all other functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting an AI assistant to the MCP server, listing chatflows, retrieving one chatflow's details, and executing it with sample input. Delivers immediate value by enabling AI assistants to use existing Flowise workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Flowise instance with 3 chatflows, **When** AI assistant calls list_chatflows, **Then** all 3 chatflows are returned with their names, IDs, types, and deployment status
2. **Given** a chatflow ID, **When** AI assistant calls get_chatflow, **Then** complete chatflow details including flowData are returned
3. **Given** a deployed chatflow ID and user question, **When** AI assistant calls run_prediction, **Then** chatflow executes and returns the response text
4. **Given** an undeployed chatflow, **When** AI assistant attempts to run_prediction, **Then** appropriate error message is returned

---

### User Story 2 - Create New Chatflows (Priority: P2)

AI assistants need to create new Flowise chatflows from scratch by providing flow structure (nodes and edges), enabling dynamic workflow generation based on user requirements.

**Why this priority**: Creation capability (0→1) is the key differentiator from existing MCP implementations. This enables AI assistants to build custom workflows on-demand rather than just querying pre-existing ones.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having AI assistant create a new chatflow with valid flowData structure and verifying it appears in the Flowise UI and can be executed. Delivers value by enabling dynamic workflow generation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid chatflow name and flowData, **When** AI assistant calls create_chatflow, **Then** new chatflow is created and its ID is returned
2. **Given** a newly created chatflow, **When** verifying in Flowise UI, **Then** chatflow appears with correct name and structure
3. **Given** invalid flowData (malformed JSON), **When** AI assistant calls create_chatflow, **Then** appropriate validation error is returned
4. **Given** chatflow creation request, **When** Flowise API is unavailable, **Then** connection error is returned with clear message

---

### User Story 3 - Update and Deploy Chatflows (Priority: P3)

AI assistants need to modify existing chatflow properties (name, flowData, deployment status) to iterate on workflows and control their availability.

**Why this priority**: Update and deployment operations enable workflow refinement and lifecycle management. While valuable, they're not essential for basic workflow creation and execution.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a chatflow, updating its name and flowData, toggling deployment status, and verifying changes persist. Delivers value by enabling workflow iteration without recreation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing chatflow, **When** AI assistant calls update_chatflow with new name, **Then** chatflow name is updated
2. **Given** an existing chatflow, **When** AI assistant calls update_chatflow with new flowData, **Then** chatflow structure is updated
3. **Given** an undeployed chatflow, **When** AI assistant calls deploy_chatflow with deployed=true, **Then** chatflow becomes deployed
4. **Given** a deployed chatflow, **When** AI assistant calls deploy_chatflow with deployed=false, **Then** chatflow becomes undeployed

---

### User Story 4 - Delete Chatflows (Priority: P4)

AI assistants need to permanently remove chatflows that are no longer needed to maintain clean workspace and manage resource usage.

**Why this priority**: Deletion is important for cleanup but not critical for core functionality. Can be deferred until other operations are stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a test chatflow, deleting it, and verifying it no longer appears in list. Delivers value by enabling workspace hygiene.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing chatflow ID, **When** AI assistant calls delete_chatflow, **Then** chatflow is permanently removed
2. **Given** a deleted chatflow ID, **When** AI assistant calls get_chatflow, **Then** "not found" error is returned
3. **Given** a non-existent chatflow ID, **When** AI assistant calls delete_chatflow, **Then** appropriate error message is returned

---

### User Story 5 - Generate AgentFlow V2 from Description (Priority: P5)

AI assistants need to generate complete AgentFlow V2 structures from natural language descriptions, enabling users to create complex agent workflows without understanding Flowise's internal structure.

**Why this priority**: This is an advanced convenience feature that leverages Flowise's built-in generation capabilities. While powerful, it's not essential for basic MCP functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a natural language description (e.g., "research agent that searches web"), generating the AgentFlow V2, and optionally creating a chatflow from the generated structure. Delivers value by lowering the technical barrier to agent creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a natural language agent description, **When** AI assistant calls generate_agentflow_v2, **Then** complete flowData structure is returned
2. **Given** generated AgentFlow V2 flowData, **When** AI assistant creates chatflow with it, **Then** chatflow is created successfully
3. **Given** vague or unclear description, **When** AI assistant calls generate_agentflow_v2, **Then** reasonable agent structure is generated with sensible defaults

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Flowise API URL is unreachable?
- How does system handle authentication failures (invalid API key)?
- What happens when flowData JSON is malformed or missing required fields?
- How does system handle very large flowData structures (>1MB)?
- What happens when attempting to execute a chatflow that is currently being updated?
- How does system handle rate limiting from Flowise API?
- What happens when chatflow execution times out?
- How does system handle concurrent operations on the same chatflow?
